What is the difference between confidence interval and credible interval

A confidence interval is a frequentist POV about the parameter value. A confidence interval gives us a range of values within which a parameter value will lie if we repeat the experiment for a certain number of times.

A credible interval is a Bayesian POV of the parameter value. It gives a range of values within which a parameter lies with certain probability.
