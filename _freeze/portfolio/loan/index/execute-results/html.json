In order to repay the loan, we have to pay Equated Monthly Payments (EMI). Every EMI payment contains a principal component and interest component. Let us look at the amortization of a loan.\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`<iframe data-deferred-src=\"appc7e45498e26dfff39155c696f3d56e3f/?w=&amp;__subapp__=1\" width=\"100%\" height=\"400\" class=\"shiny-frame shiny-frame-deferred\"></iframe>`{=html}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {style=\"text-align: justify\"}\nIf we keep the loan amount as 10,00,000; interest rate of 8% and tenure of 10 years with monthly payments, the EMI comes out to be 12133. In the very first payment, the interest component is 6667 and principal is of 5466. The interest os 54.95% of the total payment of the first payment.In every subsequent payment, the interest % goes down and the principal component goes up. If we look at the installment number 17, it is the first time the principal component is higher than the interest component. This will change if the amount, interest rate, tenure and frequency of payment changes. Change the components to check how much EMI we will pay.\n:::",
